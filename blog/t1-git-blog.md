Version Control, Git, Github

october 31, 2014


  The main goal of this post is that a beginner coder or a person with no coding background can read it and understand it. So I will try to keep it as simple as possible.

  Just stick with me and when you finish reading this you will get a general idea of what Git, Github and Version Control are. 

  VERSION CONTROL

 Version Control lets you manage your work to keep track of changes you’ve made to a project. Voila! Good things come in three so here are 3 main benefits of Version Control.
 
  1) Safety Net- If you add new things to a project and want to go back to an older version, version control lets you do this.
  
  2) Keep track - It is a great way to see the progress/history of a project. 

  3) Safety Net- That is right, this one again.

  GIT

  Git is a free  version control software. It was created by genius Linus Troval. Git helps you keep track of changes. How? Well, you install git and through a series of commands you ask git about all the changes you’ve made to a project. 

  To get a better grasp here are the primarily steps of using git.

  1) You create a folder where you decide you want to start some work, project, etc… (technical- you type this command: git init)

  2) You tell git, hey git! keep track of this folder. Now everything you do, git is acting like an all mighty all powerful camera watching every little thing you do. 

  3) So, when you decide to create a file, edit or make a change you tell git, hey git, you see all these changes I’ve done to the project save them. (technical- this are called commits in git)

  4) Here, you probably will tell me, well that is the same as just saving a document in word. Well no, let me explain, imagine you are working on a presentation for the office, made some changes, saved it, then made some more changes and saved it again. You can not go back to the original presentation. If you wanted to get back a paragraph you deleted, or a graph or anything you can't go back. Unless you keep  a  saved verion1, version2, version 3 etc... Well with git you can always go back to a previous version. 


  GITHUB

  Almost done, last part, GitHub. Now, right of the bat, git ≠ github. Git is a program used to track changes github is a social platform where you can collaborate on a project on the web.

  Why use GitHub? One word, COLLABORATION. Hackers/coders/devolopers/programmers use github to work on projects. You can put your code on github and then others can collaborate with you, adding code and fixing bugs. No need for 100 emails or making sure that everyone has the latest copy, github helps us with that. You set the project on github and merge into it anything that you want.

  There is a twist here, imagine two people work on the same thing, once you try to merge (combine your work with the work of a collaborator), git (you merge, save, and push changes to github via the software git),  will have a trouble to see what to use and will tell you about this conflict. It then gives you the option to manually say what to use for that part of the project. How cool is that!

  Should we not create a way to teach more people about this? Maybe a web app that helps consultants, investment bankers, etc learn how they can use git and github for their work? Maybe one day I will.
