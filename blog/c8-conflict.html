              Oh conflicts, everybody has conflicts and problems. The worst are those conflicts you dont even see coming specially when you are having a great day.<br><br>

              The purpose of this blog is to tell you my fellow reader about a minor conflict and reflect about it.<br><br>

              At my job, I was given the task to start a new financial product to satisfy sales requests. I did my research and together with my team found a way to implement it into testing/prototype system to show sales the flow of the product. They went crazy about the pricing, valuation and other financial numbers the product gave as output. They told us we did not know how to do anything, in a nutshell they were rough about our incompetency.<br><br>

              The source of the conflict was sales not having a complete understanding of the product they wanted. I was furious because we had done all our testing and math and knew we were on the right track. I remember not being able to sleep well that night.<br><br>

              What my team and I did was get a quote from a competitor, and show it to the sales department. That was exactly what we did and with that evidence we went on to other testing phases.<br><br>

              I would have done a couple of things differently, one, keep sales on the loop way sooner in the development of the product and have records of what is agreed in meetings. For some of our agreements we had no evidence to prove to sales that they had requested x or y. It is simple but it is important.<br><br>

              Just like in software, it is important to build software in small steps and keep the client on board very early on the process.<br><br>


              Stay tuned for more,<br><br>
