            <p> dec 10, 2014 </p>

            <p> I am one month away from my immersive experience at Dev Boot Camp making me exited and nervous at the same time. For this blog, the challenge was to look through a list values and told to choose a couple that I personally  experience in parts of my life when I have been happiest, proudest and most satisfied. The goal for this challenge is to identify ways that can help you pull it together when faced with stereotype threat or impostor syndrome.  <br><br>

            Looking through the list, there are a lot of values I can identify with, but these stood out;  Achievement, competition, freedom, growth, friendship and family.<br><br>

            I do have to say that these values are not exclusive to my own experiences but also to experiences of others that inspire me to become better. For example, I am genuinely interested about my friends achievements  at their jobs, relationships and projects and I admire the dedication, perseverance and focus of great athletes in competition. <br><br>

            Just thinking about these values brings great images and memories that makes you feel inspired and is a great way to mediate stereotype threat and impostor syndrome, since it brings out good emotions and feelings to help you through. <br><br>


            Stay tuned for more,
