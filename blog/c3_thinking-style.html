              This is the goal of this post, instead of bombarding you with what is my thinking style learning style (boring right? who cares?), I will write this blog as part one of an experiment. The experiment consists of taking the tests and trying to see if a mortal like myself benefited from knowing my VARK and my thinking style and trying to apply it in my learning to becoming a developer. <br><br>

              I invite you on this experiment so that in six months we can comment the results. <br><br>

              Here are the links to the tests <br><br>


              VARK TEST:  <a href= "http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire" > http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire </a><br><br>

              THINKING TEST: <a href= "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" > http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html </a><br><br>


            A little background from the tests: <br><br>
            <span style="empashize"> One is called the VARK. The acronym VARK stands for Visual, Aural, Read/write, and Kinesthetic sensory modalities that are used for learning information. Fleming and Mills (1992) suggested four modalities that seemed to reflect the experiences of the students and teachers. The other test is a personality test that tests your thinking style. It is called the Gregoric thinking style and the theory behind it is Gregorc's Mind Styles model provides an organized way to consider how the mind works. </span> <br><br>


            Here is the conclusion from my results. <br>

            Scores--VARK (V:13 A:8 R:3 K:10) and (CS:32 CR:40 AR:24 AS:24) <br>
            This is the short lists of things I need to try in learning new material. I should try to study by recalling pages from memory, replace words or phrases I have to learn with symbols, use pictures and examples to illustrate, use a tape recorder, and find interesting stories, examples and jokes to associate material. <br> <br>

            From my thinking style I know I like to experiment and tend to be based in reality and process information in a ordered way. In other words, for my particular challenge that is learning to code, I should try to experiment and be practical and linear with the information I want to process instead of thinking about material in abstract way or through reflection. <br><br>

            What will your approach be? <br><br>

            One more thing, I recommend that you read about Growth and Fixed mindset before you decide to embark in this challenge.In short, it will give you perspective as to how to approach any challenge and be aware of your attitude towards a problem. <br><br>


            Growth vs Fixed Mind Set: <a href= "http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" > http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/ </a><br><br>
