            Did you read that ruby on rails is hot right now? Hey, business insider just wrote a paper on ruby! That is open source right?<br><br>

            Did you understand any of that? I didn't a couple of months back and the goal of this blog is to teach my fellow audience a couple of terms on programming.<br><br>

            <h3>Programming Concepts Rails, Ruby, Open Source, Web Apps ...</h3>
            <em>check out the sources-at bottom of the page</em><br><br>

            <strong>Ruby</strong><br>
            Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.<br><br>

            <strong>Object Oriented Language (OOP)</strong><br>
            Is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.<br><br>

            <strong>Rails-(aka Ruby on Rails)</strong><br>
            Ruby on rails in an open source web framework that´s optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration.<br><br>

            So what is rails? <br>
            Rails in simple terms allows you to build web applications very very fast.<br><br>

            Who uses rails?<br>
            It is estimated that over 600,000 web apps are using rails as of today including shopify, github and hulu.<br><br>

            Why the name “ruby” on ruby on rails?<br>
            Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language.<br><br>

            The rails world:<br>
            Some argue that one of the benefits of using rails is the community itself. The rails community is known as a community that support each other.<br><br>

            <strong>Open Source Software (OSS)</strong><br>
            Is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.Open-source software is often developed in a public, collaborative manner. Open source projects, products, or initiatives are those that embrace and celebrate open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community development. <br><br>

            <strong>Web Framework (WAF)</strong><br>
            A web application framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. Picture it this way, a drawing book with some defined outilines that from where you start. The cool thing is, some of this outlines can be broken.<br><br>

            <strong>Web application </strong><br>
            A web application or web app is any software that runs in a web browser. I think aobut it as a mobile app but on the web, has users features and a goal or purpose.<br><br>

            <strong>Difference between website and web app</strong><br>
            The biggest difference is that web app has users. Think of Facebook, it is all based on user interactions. (now a big part has migrated to mobile apps i.e iphones, samsung etc but before it was all on the web). Compared to a normal website such as a blog that just renders information and/or pictures with no user interaction that are “read only” compare to “read-write-interact” of a web app.<br><br>


            That was your intro to some basic web programming concepts!<br><br>


            Stay tuned for more,<br><br>
