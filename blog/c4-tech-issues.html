            <p>Will there be a day when we no longer have to pay for education? Are there any efforts using technology to better the education of everyone?  <br></br>

            Thankfully, there is a movement, and universities, organizations and individuals are using the internet as a medium to teach and learn. One of those ways is through MOOCs (massive online open course) where you can learn for free from the best universities and best professors out there.<br></br>

            MOOCs are fairly new and are no substitute for the traditional classroom. Clever ways to use them as aids such as the flip classroom has been tested. Initial experiments in student retention and comprehension are favorable. In a nutshell flipping the classroom means, that students watch the class at home at their own pace, pause, replay or watch it again it if they need to. The homework, is done at school in a collaborative environment with the teacher and other students there to help. <br></br>

            While some of this sites are for-profit such as Cousera, that sell verified certificates ranging from 50-100 dlls, others like Khan Academy are  nonprofit. Founder Sal Khan, and I really insist that you see this video ( <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0Kq3jSsp4"> Class Day</a>) argues that there are blinders limiting the great human potential and that technology will play a big role. The good news is, there are people like him that are doing something about it.
