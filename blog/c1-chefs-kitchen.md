Andy-dev Cultural Blog Phase 0 Week One

First impressions of Dev Bootcamp

october 31, 2014


    My impression of the DBC is that people are engaged, unique and genuinely interested in learning from each other. The DBC experience is an out of the box system to learn something new with all the tools necessary (great teachers, teammates, counselors, new learning techniques, yoga for the body, engineering empathy to improve emotional intelligence to name a few) to surpass your own expectations and limits.

    Since we are little we always are compared to others. At DBC no one is ranking or grading you on your progress but yourself. Students and teachers are motivated, driven and hungry push each other to another level. It is team. Its a great culture to embrace not only for the program but outside of DBC.

    So far, DBC has exceeded my expectations. It started with the prep material  that was given before phase cero mostly on learning how to learn. The resources were amazing and gave me new techniques to try.

    The energy and commitment of my cohort so far has also exceed my expectations. Two times I posted a question in our google + community and received answers almost immediately. I too, was able to help some of my teammates with some of their questions and enjoyed the process of doing so.  I am very exited to see where I will be in 19 weeks. I am nervous but just like Rocky Balboa said, when you are a little scared you try harder.

Stay tuned for more,
