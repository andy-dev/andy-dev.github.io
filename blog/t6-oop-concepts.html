            <p> I did some research to find the easiest examples to illustrate the difference for someone new to the tech world. When begging to code you will come across the term object oriented design and functional programming. This is my attempt to explain both of these as simple as possible  <br><br>

            <strong>Functional Programming:</strong> <br><br>

            Wikipedia: In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.<br><br>

            In other words, you have tasks to be perform and you write functions to do them. What do you mean by functions? Think about it as input-output. I give the function something it returns something. No wonder why many math programs are functional programming. <br><br>

            Here is a great example I found on the web. <br><br>

            Source:http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=207071 <br><br>

            For example you might have a function that takes the coords. of a square computes the area, and you may have another function that computes the area of a triangle. By executing the square function 6 times you could compute the area of a cube. Or by executing a combination of the square and triangle functions you could compute the area of a rhomboid. As you can see you can build quite complex systems based on simple functions.<br><br>

            <strong>Object Oriented Programming OOP </strong><br><br>

            Wikipedia: is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.<br><br>

            The easiest way to think of object design is with a simple example. In OOP everything is an object that you can give behaviors and task. Imagine you want to write a program for a restaurant where the main goal is to keep an inventory and information of the plates.
            <br><br>

            With out going to technical on (methods, classes, etc) In OOP you would probably write a program and create an object that models a plate. To this object you can write all the behavior and attributes you need, color, size, behavior, shape, etc, anything you want. Once you model your plate you can create more plates (called instances) with other attributes say, plate blue and plate red. Ask them(via methods, this is called sending a message to the object) if they are clean, broken, used, stored anything you can think off.<br><br>

            While there is discussion as to what is better or if using a mix both(Java 8, Scala, F#) is the best, if you are new to programming and don't know what type of language to learn, ask yourself this question, what do I want to do with my programming skills in one year or two? Do you want to build a web app, a mobile app, a banking system? Do some research as to what type of programming langue is trending and hot for your goal(be aware these can change very quickly) and go from there. Ruby for example, is an easy friendly object oriented programming language that can build good foundations to programming and build some great web apps. <br><br>
