      <h1> Pair programming GPS 2</h1>

        <p> Name: Andres Macedo</p>
        <p><span class="qbold"> What is pair programming:</span> <br>

          Pair programming is working with someone else or with group to discuss a problem, issue or challenge. Pair programming involves  using everyones expertise to brainstorm and layout the best way to accomplish a defined task.

        </p>

        <p><span class="qbold"> Why is it important? </span><br>

          It is important because it is always best to bring different perspective, ideas or feedback when working on a problem. As the saying goes, two heads are better than one.

        </p>

        <p><span class="qbold"> Compare Driver vs Navigator.</span><br>

          There are multiple interpretations and for every pairing session it is important to define them before the session begins. Normally, the driver, similar to the car analogy, has control of the wheel steps on the gas deciding the initial path to take. The navigator acts most of the time as a copilot pointing out warnings and shortcuts in the road In coding challenge for example, the driver would start typing out and setting the skeleton of the code making andy modification necessary to get the code to work. Meanwhile the navigator would point out typos, syntax and/or research the web for documentation.

          It is important to know when to program and always set a goal on what it is you want to achieve in your session.

          This was my second gps for dev bootcamp. It was fun to put my knowledge of html and css to the challenge of building a simple website in less than hour. It was good to talk to the guide and get feedback as to what was definition for pair programming. This sessions are always great to get to know people that are in the same boat as you or that were in the same boat and be able to pick their brain. Overall the challenge was not tedious but I did realize I have to work on getting my paths correctly so that the html file can use my stylesheet and images. I also learned outside the scope of the challenge as to why you should try to keep styling in a styling sheet and got some pointers from our guide as to what to expect in the future when dealing with multi platforms.
