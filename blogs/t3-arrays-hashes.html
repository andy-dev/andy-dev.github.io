      <h4>Arrays vs Hashes</h4>

      <p> november 14, 2014 </p>
      <p>Hi, the main goal of this blog is to explain people with no/or close to none background in coding what arrays and hashes are. Arrays and hashes are use to store data. That is it. <br><br>

      Let me jump right into it keeping it as simple as possible. When you want to tell your computer to remember something you declare a variable and assign it to what it is you want to remember. For example, age_ray= 20. So now you don't have to remember the Ray´s age, it is just sitting there stored in the value age_ray waiting for you to tell it to print it, modify it, erase it or anything you want to to with it.<br><br></p>

      <box>But what if you want to assign a variable called my favorite numbers? Maybe these are the numbers you use in your lottery ticket? Should you set a variable name for number1= 8, number2=2 etc? The answer is no. You can use an array. To use an array you would do something like this. my_numbers= [8,2,23,26,14,18]. Now you have a variable called my_numbers that stores your lottery numbers. To set up an array you need your variable name, = sign also called assignment operator, brackets [] and commas to separate your list inside your brackets. Easy, right?<br><br>

      The great thing about arrays is that you can ask your computer to do tons of stuff. You can tell it to give you the first item of your list, the third, sum the values, insert values, the list goes on and on. One crucial thing to know about arrays is, that arrays store items counting from zero. In other words, if you want to see what is the first value of your list you would tell your computer print my_numbers[0]. Weird right? Arrays use an index, it starts from 0 and goes up for every value in the array. In our example above the 8 corresponds to index 0, 26 corresponds to index 3 and 2 corresponds to index _? You got this!<br><br>

      Now we have hashes and hashes are really similar to arrays. Remember that arrays use a numerical index that match the elements of an array. Hashes use keys and values. For example, capital_city = {:Texas => "Austin",:California => "Sacramento",} <br><br>

      Hashes work almost the same as arrays but instead of having a numbered index we define the key and value for each element. The keys in this example are Texas and California and the values Austin and Sacramento. If you want to access the capital city of Texas you would do print capital_city[:Texas]. <br><br>

      If you want to read more about arrays and hashes here is the place to start <br><br>
