      <h4>Stereotype Threat</h4>
      <p> dec 5, 2014 </p>

      <p> def. Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group  (Steele & Aronson, 1995). <br><br>

      Stereotype threat in simple terms is doing something and know you can be judge or treated different. The reason if due to your social identity, and this can be anything that gives you a sense of who you are from the groups memberships or social categories such as race, age, sexual orientation, religion, gender, nationality etc.<br><br>

      I can not imagine people dealing with racism, sex and sexual orientation go through. Just watching the news of young kids committing suicide because they are judged on their sexual orientation is heartbreaking. Some of this situations are just horrible. I am no expert to give advice on this subject but I do believe that watching and learning about successful people that have lived through different stereotype threats is a great way to go about it. <br><br>

      Believe it our not we all face stereotype threats (and a lot if you think about it). After going through some videos and articles I tried to identify of the many times I have faced it. I remember one particular situation when I was switching school as a kid I had to take an entrance exam for admission to an american school and a friend of mine did not have to take the test because he was from the United States. I felt pressured that I had to perform and that I was going to be judge to see if I "belonged" in the school since I was not from the States. I remember it was stressful and at times I could not even go through the study booklet, I wasted time just thinking of my performance or possible under performance on the test. Long story short, I did get in and thinking back I think it was thanks to my mom’s feedback and persuasion. She went through the study booklet with me and said things like, yeah! that is it! You are doing great with these problems, this exam is going to be easier than we think, just continue working hard on the booklet I know you will ace it. It was her feedback and support that help me get through my fears.<br><br>

      Claude M Steele, a leading social physiologist that has researched and experimented with the stereotype threat explains that good feedback can have an empowering effect.  What type of feedback? Something like this: “hey I’ve seen your work and I think you can be great at this” (similar to my example in the last paragraph) This type of feedback can be even life changing. With that I want to finish with this two great quotes that wrap this concept. <br><br>

     <em> "Whether you think you can or think you can't, either way you are right" - Henry Ford.</em> <br><br>

     <em> "When you visualize, then you materialize. If you've been there in the mind you'll go there in the body" - Denis Waitley Dr.</em><br>

      Stay tuned for more,
