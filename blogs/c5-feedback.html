      <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p> november 28, 2014 </p>
      <p> Everything we learn is through feedback, It is kind of obvious but we don't really think much about it. At Dev Boot Camp we are thought that feedback is crucial to our leaning. The easiest example of learning is watching kids and all the experimenting they do. We learn by experimenting, can I touch that? Is it hot? Cold? Can I walk faster? Can I run? Can I flip? Can I jump higher? <br><br>

      For the most part, we do not get constant feedback as adults. Think about your job or your school? How often is feedback? Is it enough?<br><br>

      At DBC we are given feedback at the end of every week for every time we work on a challenge with someone. Challenges typically last an hour to two hours and students work in pairs(sometimes a pair and a guide) to solve them. Do you get feedback from other students at your school every time you work together? From you teacher/professor? Is it one evaluation per semester? From your meetings during the week at work?  It is intimidating to know you will receive feedback from all your pairing sessions/meetings/ etc… but it is a great tool to know what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong and what you can improve. <br><br>

      There are 3 rules to give feedback, it has to be actionable, specific and kind. The best way to explain it is giving you an example of good feedback. <br><br>

      Feedback Example <br><br>
      <em>It was great to work with you. You are very patient and have a great way to explain your thought process. I particularly liked the way you explained how we could get rid of steps 5-6 in the algorithm. For actionable feedback I would suggest that you take a few moments to outline the way you want to solve the problem, I felt you jumped into the problem too quickly before we could agree on the goal for the meeting. Other than that, great job!</em><br><br>

      My personal take on the feedback I’ve received at DBC is that it works. I‘ve received some great actionable feedback on things I can do better and improve and I really like that it is specific on things I do correctly that my pairing partner appreciate or benefit from. What really drew my attention is how negative we can be with ourselves. In one pairing session where I had a guide and a pair to work through a coding challenge I felt that I did not do a very good job and that I was way behind the material. However, when I received the feedback from that session I realize the complete opposite, that I was technically ahead with/of the curriculum. It easy how we can be so negative about ourselves and it is great to know that sometimes we are doing better than what you actually think. <br><br><br>

      Stay tuned for more,
      <br></br>
