      <h4>Questions????</h4>
      <p> jan 7, 2015 </p>

      <center><em><strong>"The question is just as important as the answer"--Charlie Rose</strong></em></center><br>

      <p> Have you ever heard someone say, there is no question too stupid? Or, there is no bad question? I disagree. There are bad questions. <br><br>

      I've come up with a few basic guidelines to asking good questions.<br><br>

      1) Research, don't just ask because of asking, try to figure it out by yourself. <br><br>

      2) Make your question one line<br><br>

      3) Make sure for spelling and grammar<br><br>

      Most of the times,you can find the answer in a manual, a book, in a procedure, in an index or the web. If you do your research and maybe find an answer but still don’t understand it, then by all means, approach someone or an audience and say, hey I do not understand ______. I found this______ looking for an answer. This will let people know you really want to find out the answer and done your work.<br><br>

      Normally I would say stick to one line question and if you have to explain something keep in in bullets points and/or diagrams. Nobody likes to read a big paragraph.<br><br>

      Third and lastly, proofread. Everyone makes typos but if you have big errors, people will just assume you don't care that much for the answer. (trust me on this)<br><br>

      In analyzing some of my questions on my google+ account I can definitely see all errors I just told you. Some questions where already asked or could be found on a manual,web etc. I see questions with poor grammar and questions with vague titles and or explanations. However, I see great questions, even questions people have collaborated and all learned from them.<br><br>

      In conclusion, keep in mind that it is easy to ask great questions that not just you, but others can learn from. <br><br><br>

      Stay tuned for more,
      <br></br>
